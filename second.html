       <p> <b>User Story :</b>  This app is an interactive story.  You meet this bunny named Zoe and you get on an adventure with her.

<p><b>Backlog Item:</b> I started in the design view with the images. I got all the images I wanted and uploaded them to the app. Than I added a table arrangement and added canvas into the table arrangement and upload the images I wanted to the canvas. I make the first two images I wanted as the first two images than make the rest not visible. I add a labels, and a start over buttons . Than I went into the blocks view and a started programing for the first two images I had visible ,than after I had those two working I had started programming for the image that would come after the first two images. And in that I code I made it so than when the image is click the last two images would be invisible and than go to the next image with text popping up with instructions for the user so they know what to do to go to the next image. Than I did the same thing for the rest of the images making should each image works as I program.</p>
