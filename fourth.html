       <p> <b>Goal of the project :</b> The purpose of this project is to program the SDV to move to each grid I choose. I could three grids. Grid two easy grid 5 intermediate and grid eight difficult. However I can only use a single 2D list to program it. Each grid has an orange end , a green start , and a red block that SDV has to move around. .</p>

        <p><b>Pseudo code :</b>
when the program start 
set col to 1
set row to 1
set grid to path #2 
make grid to path #5 
make grid to path #8
while row is less than 6 
set col to 1 
while col is less than 6 
if item row , col of grid equal's 1 than 
set pen color to orange on brain 
print X on brain
else if item row , col of grid equal's 2 than 
set pen color to red on brain 
print X on brain 
 else if item row, col of grid equal's 3 than 
set pen color to green on brain 
print X on brain 
else 
set pen color to white on brain 
print X on brain 
change col by 1 
set cursor to next row 
change row by 1 
if item 5 5 of grid = 3 and item 4 2 of grid = 0 then 
print Path #2 on brain 
repeat 4 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast LT and wait 
repeat 4 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast LT and wait 
else if item 3 5 of grid = 2 and item 4 2 = 2 then
print Path #5 on brain 
broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast LT and wait 
repeat 3 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast LT and wait 
repeat 3 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast LT and wait 
broadcast FWD and wait 
else if item 1 1 of grid = 3 then 
print Path #8 on brain 
broadcast FWD and wait
broadcast RT and wait 
repeat 3 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast RT and wait 
repeat 3 broadcast FWD and wait 
broadcast RT and wait 
broadcast FWD and wait 
else 
print no grid selected.
when I receive LT 
spin motor1 reverse for 200 degrees 
when I receive LT 
spin motor2 forward for 200
when I receive FWD 
spin motor1 forward for 360 degrees 
when I receive FWD 
spin motor2 forward for 360 degrees
when I receive RT
spin motor1 forward for 200 degrees 
when I receive RT 
spin motor2 reverse for 200 degrees

   <p> <b> Reflection : </b>   2D list were helpful with programming this code because it made it easy for me to tell the SDV where and how it is supposed to be moving. I used nested loops because I was using 2D lists and nested loops help store multidimensional data.  </p>
